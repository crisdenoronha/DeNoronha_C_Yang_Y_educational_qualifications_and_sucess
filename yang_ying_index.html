        <h2>Start Paragraph & Reason Paragraph<br>Educational Qualifications</h2>
        <p>
            A number of people hold a view that educational qualifications is a prerequisite for being successful, while others think that educational certifications are not the necessary conditions for getting success. In my opinion, I think people should get educational qualifications which help them become successful men quickly.

            Firstly, success is based on real-life and they need money to achieve it. If they want to earn money, they need to find a job that provides basic needs for themselves. However, if they do not have an educational qualification, they cannot find a position in job markets. The reason is that educational qualification is a prerequisite for a job finder. For example, if a male wants to be an accountant, he needs to get a certification from a college. If a female hopes to find a teaching position, she should hold a bachelor's degree from a university. All in all, when people cannot demonstrate that they have educational qualifications in the interview processing, their resume will be directly thrown into the trash can.  </p>

            However, some people may have an idea that some successful people do not spend much time on study and they also become wealthy and powerful people. In fact, so many people cannot earn so much money like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. The definition of successful men for most people is that only just finding a job and providing a comfortable life for family members. For example, they want to buy a house and born two babies. They also want to have a free weekend and enjoy stay with their families. If they want to live such good life, they must have an educational qualification. So, educational certification is the requirement of a successful life for people.

        <p>
            In my opinion, getting most people’s successful life is only requiring an educational certification. People should get their educational qualification before looking for a job because most companies will check every applicant’s educational background before hiring the person.
