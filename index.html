        <h2>Educational qualifications do not necessarily bring success.</h2>

        <p> Studying has always been important to increase the chances of getting a job, but just taking a course or university will not guarantee professional success.
            To be successful in a career you need to know how to make good decisions, work in a team and have good communication with your manager or client.
        </p>
            
        <p> During a working day it is necessary to decide the best alternative to solve a problem. 
            Or at some important moments in your career, you will have to choose which way to take.
            In these cases, only a more mature person will be able to make good choices. Maturity is not related to age, 
            but professional attitude and experience in a work environment.</p>

        <p>Another important aspect of being successful is knowing how to work in a team. We cannot do everything alone and teamwork 
           can do a project better and bring visibility to more people.</p>
         
        <p>To conclude, there is one more very important quality that can be improved with study but needs to be practiced, communication. 
            It is necessary to understand the environment to not only use the right words but also communicate the right subject at the right time.</p>
