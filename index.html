        <p>
            A number of people hold a view that educational qualifications is a prerequisite for being successful, while others think that educational certifications are not the necessary conditions for getting success. In my opinion, I think people should get educational qualifications which help them become successful men quickly.

            Firstly, success is based on real-life and they need money to achieve it. If they want to earn money, they need to find a job that provides basic needs for themselves. However, if they do not have an educational qualification, they cannot find a position in job markets. The reason is that educational qualification is a prerequisite for a job finder. For example, if a male wants to be an accountant, he needs to get a certification from a college. If a female hopes to find a teaching position, she should hold a bachelor's degree from a university. All in all, when people cannot demonstrate that they have educational qualifications in the interview processing, their resume will be directly thrown into the trash can.  </p>
