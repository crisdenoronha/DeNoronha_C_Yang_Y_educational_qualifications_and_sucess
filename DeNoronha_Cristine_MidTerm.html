        <h1>A discussion about Educational Qualifications</h1>
        <h2>Start Paragraph & Reason Paragraph<br>Educational Qualifications</h2>
        <p>
            A number of people hold a view that educational qualifications is a prerequisite for being successful, while others think that educational certifications are not the necessary conditions for getting success. In my opinion, I think people should get educational qualifications which help them become successful men quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, success is based on real-life and they need money to achieve it. 
            If they want to earn money, they need to find a job that provides basic needs for themselves.
            However, if they do not have an educational qualification, they cannot find a position in job markets.
        </p> 
        <p> The reason is that educational qualification is a prerequisite for a job finder. 
             For example, if a male wants to be an accountant, he needs to get a certification from a college. 
             If a female hopes to find a teaching position, she should hold a bachelor's degree from a university. 
             All in all, when people cannot demonstrate that they have educational qualifications in the interview processing, 
             their resume will be directly thrown into the trash can.  </p>

        <h1>Against Paragraph & Second Paragraph</h1>

        <h2>Educational qualifications do not necessarily bring success.</h2>

        <p> Studying has always been important to increase the chances of getting a job, but just taking a course or university will not guarantee professional success.
            To be successful in a career you need to know how to make good decisions, work in a team and have good communication with your manager or client.
        </p>
            
        <p> During a working day it is necessary to decide the best alternative to solve a problem. 
            Or at some important moments in your career, you will have to choose which way to take.
            In these cases, only a more mature person will be able to make good choices. Maturity is not related to age, 
            but professional attitude and experience in a work environment.</p>

        <p>Another important aspect of being successful is knowing how to work in a team. We cannot do everything alone and teamwork 
           can do a project better and bring visibility to more people.</p>
         
        <p>To conclude, there is one more very important quality that can be improved with study but needs to be practiced, communication. 
            It is necessary to understand the environment to not only use the right words but also communicate the right subject at the right time.</p>

        <h1>Conflict Paragraph</h1>

            <p> So what is more important, hard skills or soft skills? <br>
                Without study you cannot perform a task, but if your behavior is not adequate you cannot keep your job.
            </p>

        <h1>Solution Paragraph</h1>

            <p> To develop hard skills and soft skills, during college or university studies, 
                it is necessary to practice these skills in an internship or work.<br>So after graduation the student will be really qualified.
